# GSB Java Practical Test
#### Create a single page application with the following details:
- Use Java for the backend (Spring boot)
- Use Angular for the frontend
- Create a form to register users
- Display all users in other section of the page
- You have to use Git to control versions of the code and upload it in platforms like
- Github in order to share it with us

#### Considerations:
- No need to apply any css framework such as bootstrap, bulma, tailwind etc. (Add it if you want)
- You can use only one variable to save the users (No need to use database)

#### Optional (plus):
- Deploy your Project in AWS or Azure and share the link with us.
- You can use heroku as a last option
